# PDFDancer Copy & Messaging Guide

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-13
**Purpose:** Maintain consistent, effective messaging across all PDFDancer properties

---

## Core Value Proposition

**PDFDancer's unique differentiator:**
> Edit text in any real-world PDF. Even ones you didn't create.

Most PDF SDKs work, but they can't truly edit text in real-world PDFs that users didn't generate themselves. This is our killer feature.

**Important:** Never claim other PDF SDKs "don't work" or that we're "the first" or "the only" solution. The truth is more powerful and specific: we can edit text in real-world PDFs that users didn't create. State this capability directly without false competitive claims.

## Messaging Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not Generic

❌ **Avoid generic claims:**
- "Best-in-class solution"
- "Cutting-edge technology"
- "Seamless integration"
- "Robust functionality"
- "Done right" (too vague)

✅ **Use concrete, specific language:**
- "Edit text in any real-world PDF"
- "Pixel-perfect positioning"
- "No corruption. No surprises."
- "Integration takes hours, not weeks"
- "Zero broken documents"

### 2. Lead with Outcomes, Not Features

❌ **Feature-focused:**
- "Advanced PDF rendering engine"
- "Comprehensive API coverage"
- "Multiple language support"

✅ **Outcome-focused:**
- "Stop spending weeks debugging PDF corruption"
- "Ship faster with working code examples"
- "Edit PDFs without breaking them"

### 3. Acknowledge Developer Pain

Developers have been burned by PDF tools before. Show empathy.

✅ **Good examples:**
- "Stop Fighting PDFs. Start Editing Them."
- "These problems end here."
- "Finally, a PDF SDK that works on real-world files."

### 4. Be Honest, Never Mislead

❌ **False claims:**
- "The first PDF SDK that actually works" (other SDKs do work)
- "The only solution for PDF editing" (not true)
- "100% compatible with all PDFs" (impossible)

✅ **Truthful positioning:**
- "Edit text in any real-world PDF. Even ones you didn't create."
- "The PDF SDK that handles real-world documents"
- "Pixel-perfect editing without corruption"

### 5. Show, Don't Tell

Demonstrate capabilities and transparency through action, not announcements.

❌ **Telling (defensive, preachy):**
- "Here's proof we're legitimate"
- "Nothing to hide"
- "We're transparent about everything"
- "This really works, trust us"

✅ **Showing (confident, natural):**
- Display live metrics without commentary
- Provide working code examples in docs
- Share specific customer outcomes in testimonials
- Demo actual PDF editing capabilities

**Key insight:** When you announce something is proof or tell people to trust you, it creates doubt. When you simply show the evidence, it builds credibility naturally.

## Key Messages by Use Case

### Hero/Homepage
```
Title: "Stop Fighting PDFs."
Secondary Title: "Start Editing Them."
Subtitle: "Edit text in any real-world PDF. Pixel-perfect. No corruption."
```

**Important:** The unique differentiator is editing text in real-world PDFs that users didn't create themselves. This is the killer feature that sets PDFDancer apart.

### Pricing
```
Title: "Start Free. Scale When Ready."
Subtitle: "No signup. No API key. Just start coding. Upgrade removes watermarks."
```

**Why this works:** Emphasizes the zero-friction free tier. API keys are auto-generated transparently—users can literally start coding without any signup. This is a major differentiator.

### Quick Start / Onboarding
```
Title: "Add PDFDancer to Your AI Coding Assistant"
Subtitle: "One command. Then start prompting your AI. That's it."
```

**Why this works:** Clearly identifies the AI-assisted coding context. Users immediately understand they can use PDFDancer with Claude Code, Cursor, or other AI coding tools.

### Metrics & Statistics
```
Badge: "Live Statistics"
Title: "Our API in Action"
Subtitle: [None - let the numbers speak]
```

**Show, Don't Tell Principle:**
- **Don't** announce it's proof ("Here's proof we're legitimate")
- **Don't** be defensive ("Nothing to hide")
- **Don't** use jargon ("Real-time telemetry")
- **Do** create a vibrant impression through live numbers
- **Do** let the metrics speak for themselves
- **Do** demonstrate transparency through action, not words

### Demo Sections
```
Title: "Watch it work."
Subtitle: "Move images. Reposition headers. Edit text inline. Change fonts. Simple API calls that just work."
```

**Important:** Avoid introducing concepts that weren't mentioned earlier (e.g., "Impossible" when it was never discussed). Keep copy contextually appropriate. Also watch for repetition—using "pixel-perfect" 3+ times on one page dilutes its impact.

### Documentation
```
Focus: Working code examples, clear explanations
Avoid: Assuming knowledge, vague descriptions
```

### Error Messages
```
Be specific about what failed and how to fix it
Avoid: Generic "something went wrong"
```

## Copy Rules

### Length & Clarity

1. **Headlines:** 5-8 words maximum
2. **Subheadlines:** 12-20 words maximum
3. **Body copy:** Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
4. **CTAs:** Action verb + clear outcome

### Formatting

1. **Use sentence case** for headlines (not Title Case)
2. **Bold key phrases** sparingly for emphasis
3. **Use bullets** for feature lists
4. **Short paragraphs** for readability

### Numbers & Metrics

- "10 seconds to start"
- "Zero corruption"
- "99.9% uptime SLA"
- "<100 ms processing time"

❌ **Vague:**
- "Fast setup"
- "Highly reliable"
- "Enterprise-grade"

2. **Is it truthful?** (No false promises)
3. **Is it clear?** (No confusion about meaning)
4. **Is it actionable?** (Does it tell users what to do)
5. **Is it empathetic?** (Does it acknowledge pain points)

### A/B Testing Priorities

**High Impact:**
- Hero headlines
- Primary CTA copy
- Pricing page titles

**Medium Impact:**
- Feature descriptions
- Subheadlines
- Secondary CTAs

**Low Impact:**
- Footer copy
- Fine print
- Error message wording

---

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Hero

❌ **Before:**
```
"The Ultimate PDF Solution"
"Process documents faster with our advanced technology"
```

✅ **After:**
```
"Stop Fighting PDFs. Start Editing Them."
"Edit text in any real-world PDF. Pixel-perfect. No corruption."
```

**Why:** More specific, acknowledges pain, states unique value.

---

### Example 2: Feature Description

❌ **Before:**
```
"Advanced Text Editing Capabilities
Our sophisticated text manipulation engine provides comprehensive editing functionality across all document types."
```

✅ **After:**
```
"Edit Text in Any PDF
Change text, fonts, and formatting in real-world PDFs—even ones you didn't create. No corruption. No surprises."
```

**Why:** Outcome-focused, specific, addresses key concern (corruption).

---

### Example 3: Pricing

❌ **Before:**
```
"Flexible Pricing Options
Choose from our variety of plans designed to meet your needs"
```

✅ **After:**
```
"Start Free. Scale When Ready.
No credit card. No signup. No limits on what you can build."
```

**Why:** Removes friction, clear progression, emphasizes freedom.

---

### Example 4: CTA Button

❌ **Before:**
```
[Learn More]
```

✅ **After:**
```
[Start Editing PDFs in 10 Seconds - Free]
```

**Why:** Specific timeframe, clear outcome, removes risk.

---

### Example 5: Error Message

❌ **Before:**
```
"An error occurred. Please try again."
```

✅ **After:**
```
"PDF parsing failed: Invalid font encoding on page 3.
Try re-exporting your PDF with embedded fonts, or contact support if this persists."
```

**Why:** Specific problem, actionable solution, clear next step.

---

### Example 6: Metrics Section

❌ **Before (too defensive):**
```
"Live Statistics"
"PDFDancer in Motion"
"Real-time telemetry direct from production. Nothing to hide."
```

❌ **Also wrong (too jargony):**
```
"Live Statistics"
"Real-time Activity"
"Production telemetry across the API."
```

✅ **After:**
```
Badge: "Live Statistics"
Title: "Our API in Action"
[No subtitle - numbers displayed directly]
```

**Why:** "Show, don't tell" - numbers create vibrant impression of activity and transparency without defensive language or jargon. Let the metrics speak for themselves.

---

### Example 7: AI-Assisted Coding Context

❌ **Before:**
```
"⚡ 10 Seconds to Start"
"10 Seconds From Zero to PDF Editing"
"One command. Then start prompting. That's it."
```

✅ **After:**
```
"⚡ 10 Seconds to Start"
"Add PDFDancer to Your AI Coding Assistant"
"One command. Then start prompting your AI. That's it."
```

**Why:** Makes it explicit that this is about AI-assisted development. "Your AI" clarifies the context that was implied but not stated.

---

### Example 8: Avoiding Out-of-Context References

❌ **Before:**
```
"This Is What 'Impossible' Looks Like"
"Move images. Reposition headers. Edit text inline. All with simple API calls. All pixel-perfect. All without breaking your PDFs."
```

✅ **After:**
```
"Watch it work."
"Move images. Reposition headers. Edit text inline. Change fonts. Simple API calls that just work."
```

**Why:** "Impossible" was never introduced earlier on the page—confusing context. Also removed triple repetition of "All" and "pixel-perfect" (which appeared 3 times on landing page). More concise, more natural.

---

### Example 9: False Competitive Claims

❌ **Before:**
```
"The first PDF SDK that actually works"
```

✅ **After:**
```
"Edit text in any real-world PDF. Even ones you didn't create."
```

**Why:** First version makes false claim—other SDKs do work. The truth is more powerful: PDFDancer can edit text in real-world PDFs that users didn't create themselves. That's the unique differentiator, stated truthfully and specifically.

---

## Don'ts - Never Do These

1. ❌ **Never claim to be "the first" or "the only"** unless absolutely verifiable
2. ❌ **Never use superlatives without proof** ("best", "fastest", "easiest")
3. ❌ **Never promise 100% compatibility** (PDFs are too complex)
4. ❌ **Never use "seamless" or "effortless"** (lazy marketing words)
5. ❌ **Never write "click here"** (use descriptive link text)
6. ❌ **Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis** (use bold or italics)
7. ❌ **Never use multiple exclamation marks!!!** (one is enough!)
8. ❌ **Never promise instant results** unless true (be realistic)
9. ❌ **Never hide pricing or terms** (transparency builds trust)
10. ❌ **Never ignore user feedback** (iterate based on real responses)
11. ❌ **Never repeat key phrases 3+ times on one page** (dilutes impact, sounds repetitive)
12. ❌ **Never introduce concepts out of context** (if you reference "impossible," mention it earlier first)
13. ❌ **Never be defensive** ("nothing to hide", "actually works", "really reliable")
14. ❌ **Never use jargon when simple words work** ("telemetry" → "activity", "across the API" → unnecessary)

## Localization Notes

When translating or adapting copy:

1. **Preserve tone** - Direct, confident, empathetic
2. **Keep it specific** - Don't make vague in translation
3. **Adapt idioms** - "Stop fighting" might need cultural adjustment
4. **Maintain honesty** - Don't overclaim in any language
5. **Test with native speakers** - Ensure natural flow
